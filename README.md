# PLS-NLP-Stackoverflow
This repository contains the python scripts and NLP programs used to parse [StackOverflow data dump](https://archive.org/details/stackexchange) in an on-going effort at Columbia University's Programming Systems Laboratory to identify issues developers face using major deep-learning frameworks. 

We consider pandas, tensorflow and keras. Our corpus consists of all posts that are tagged with at least one of the 3 DL libraries and have any activity in 2018 (including original post, comment, answer, etc).
